An app to calculate health metrics such as BMI, Body fat and BMR.

This is a health metrics calculator website that can be used to calculate your Body Mass Index (BMI), Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), and Body Fat percentage.

BMI Calculator  

The BMI calculator allows you to enter your height and weight to determine your BMI. BMI is a measure of body fat based on height and weight. It is commonly used to determine whether someone is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.

BMR Calculator  

The BMR calculator allows you to calculate the number of calories your body burns at rest. This is the number of calories you would burn if you were to stay in bed all day. Knowing your BMR can help you determine how many calories you need to consume to maintain your weight, lose weight, or gain weight.

Body Fat Calculator  

The body fat calculator allows you to enter your bmi, age, and gender to determine your body fat percentage. Body fat percentage is the percentage of your body weight that is made up of fat. Knowing your body fat percentage can help you determine whether you are at a healthy weight and how much body fat you need to lose to achieve your goals.
